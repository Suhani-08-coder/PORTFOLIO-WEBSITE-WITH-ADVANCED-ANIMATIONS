DESCRIPTION:
This is a full-stack personal portfolio website designed to showcase skills and projects in a visually engaging way. Unlike static portfolios, this project integrates a Node.js & MongoDB backend to collect real-time contact form submissions.

The frontend is built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, utilizing GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to deliver high-performance, smooth animations (scroll effects, text reveals, and cursor interactions) that enhance user experience without compromising speed.
